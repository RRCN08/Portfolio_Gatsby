                <p> Hailing from Kochi, I am that kid who happened to stumble on to the world of design in his high school. Coffee was my favourite drink until it recently started giving me migraines. :')</p>
                <p>I found my escape in video games since the early Road Rash and Dave era. In case you want an in-depth review of me, you will have to poke into my little violet diary of poems.</p>
                <p>One more thing, I love music. So here's a playlist for you. :)</p>
