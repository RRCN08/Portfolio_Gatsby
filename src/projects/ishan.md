# what
## THE CHALLENGE

As a second-year student at IIT Guwahati, we had our first-semester thesis project for four months. I worked under Dr Abhishek Shrivastava to represent the various dialects, demographics, and recordings of the Assamese language in a suitable medium.

The project was based on an ongoing research project at the time, under Dr Priyankoo Sarmah, which studied the effects of socio-linguistic factors on vowel pattern variation across different dialects of Assamese.

* To create a soundscape interface derived from the data from a research project for anyone to access and interpret. *

# how
## THE DESIGN PROCESS

1. Study existing designs
by scouring the internet and reading up papers.

2. Analyse the flaws
while extensively using the designs and identifying the pain-points.

3. Ideate the concepts
through brainstorming and repeated sessions with the guide.

4. Design and reiterate
through feedback and rebuilding the design to perfect it.
