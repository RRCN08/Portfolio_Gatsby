# what
## THE CHALLENGE

Nutanix provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualisation and storage into one integrated solution that connects to public cloud services.

During my two months over there, I worked on their flagship product, Prism, an end-to-end management solution for IT administrators to centrally manage their entire hardware stack, including storage, compute and virtual machines (VMs), all from a single tab.

* To create a dashboard and redesign a section to give IT administrators more visibility into their entire IT ecosystem beyond just infrastructure. *

# how
## THE DESIGN PROCESS

1. Research and Insights
Study of the product and carving out a problem space along with competitor analysis.

2. Ideate
Brainstorming sessions with the design team, throwing ideas together on the experience and the design.

3. Design
Paper sketches of the concepts and mid-fidelity designs are discussed with the developers to see if these ideas can be aligned with the product.

4. Finalise
Converge onto the finer details, incorporating the Nutanix Design guidelines.
